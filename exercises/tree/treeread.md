Iterating through a tree= traversal

there are different orders of traversal

breadth-first-travesal: start from top, then go left to right, go through a row b4 going to the next row

depth-first-traversal: start from top, go through the childern and grandchildren on left, then go to middle children and gchildren, then right

parent array, children[] is equal to children node(data & their children array)
